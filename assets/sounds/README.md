# Sound Assets

This directory should contain the following sound files:

- `merge.wav` - Sound played when tiles merge
- `move.wav` - Sound played when tiles move
- `win.wav` - Sound played when player reaches 2048
- `game_over.wav` - Sound played when game is over

You can add your own sound files here. Make sure they are in WAV format and have the correct names.
